			I'm a product designer based in NYC. Currently, I'm building restaurant technology at Toast.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-2 text-gray-500 leading-7">
			Previously, I studed Civil Engineering at Northwestern University, where I planned on becoming
			an architect. Those plans changed once I took computer science classes and learned how much I
			enjoy designing software.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-2 text-gray-500 leading-7">
			These days, Iâ€™m thinking and reading about climate solutions, blockchain possibilities, and
			other design media (e.g. graphic, interior).
